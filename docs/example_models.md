# Coupling CWatM and IRENA FlexTool	

# Required modifications

A series of modifications are needed in order to operate CWatM in a loop with any other model. In this implementation, the models are run in sequence with a given time window.

New variables are introduced in the ini file used by CWatM and are readily available in the toolbox workflow *basic_model.json* file. If you import an existing init file, you may create these variables manually from the spinedatabase.

| entity name            | Parameter name | Role                                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FILE_PATHS             | PathCombinednc | This variable defines the location where the final output is located. |
| OPTIONS                | loopcount      | This is a boolean value that starts with the value FALSE for every new iteration |
| OPTIONS                | looptoolbox    | Boolean to tell if you are running CWatM in a loop (TRUE) or not (FALSE). |
| TIME-RELATED_CONSTANTS | RollFlexTool   | Time duration of the CWatM model (D, M, Y)                   |
| TIME-RELATED_CONSTANTS | StepFlexTool   | The date for the end of the simulation                       |

Some of the existing variables from CWatM need to modify to access init values generated by CWatM
