# Why integrating hydrology and energy system models

## For Whom?

IRENA FlexTool was primarily designed to be used for planning the energy transition in developing countries. It is developed by VTT for IRENA and it is distributed to IRENA members. IRENA FlexTool is also accessible on GitHub. With the growing complexity of energy system planning, the need to have an understanding of where the water comes from and goes become necessary to better manage hydropower stations that are installed along a river basin. To this extent, 

## How does it work

## CWatM-spinetoolbox

This [SpineToolbox](https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox/	"Github Link") project aimed at implementing the [CWatM Model](https://github.com/iiasa/CWatM	"Github Link") and creating the data workflow as well as scenario management . 

## Reading the workflow

To run this workflow, you will first need to setup SpineToolbox on your machine. Please refer to the [SpineToolbox](https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox/tree/0.8-dev	"Github Link") project to install and run it. This workflow was made using the 0.8 version as it includes new features as well as the new SpineDBapi.

All initial template files are available in the repo.
